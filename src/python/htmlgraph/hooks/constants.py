Shared Constants for HtmlGraph Hooks

This module centralizes constants used across multiple hook files to eliminate
duplication and ensure consistency.

Constants:
    NEVER_BLOCK_TOOLS: Tools that should never be blocked by enforcement
    DRIFT_QUEUE_FILE: Filename for drift detection queue

Note:
    SUBAGENT_SUFFIXES and SUBAGENT_TYPES were removed in favour of reading
    the native ``agent_id`` / ``agent_type`` fields that Claude Code provides
    in every PreToolUse / PostToolUse hook input.  Session-ID suffix matching
    was an unreliable heuristic; native fields are authoritative.
