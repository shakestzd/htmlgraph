# HtmlGraph

**Local-first observability and coordination platform for AI-assisted development.**

No external infrastructure required — no Postgres, no Redis, no cloud sync. HTML files as nodes, hyperlinks as edges, SQLite for fast local queries, and a FastAPI + HTMX live dashboard out of the box.

> **Design philosophy:** "HTML is All You Need" — work items are standard HTML files readable in any browser, diffable in git, and editable without tooling.

## Why HtmlGraph?

Modern AI agent systems are drowning in complexity:
- Neo4j/Memgraph → Docker, JVM, learn Cypher
- Redis/PostgreSQL → More infrastructure
- Custom protocols → More learning curves

**HtmlGraph uses what you already know:**
- ✅ HTML files = Graph nodes
- ✅ `<a href>` = Graph edges
- ✅ CSS selectors = Query language
- ✅ Any browser = Visual interface
- ✅ Git = Version control (diffs work!)

## Installation

```bash
pip install htmlgraph
```

## Quick Start

### CLI (recommended for new projects)

```bash
htmlgraph init --install-hooks
htmlgraph serve
```

This bootstraps:
- `index.html` dashboard at the project root
- `.htmlgraph/events/` append-only JSONL event stream (Git-friendly)
- `.htmlgraph/index.sqlite` analytics cache (rebuildable; gitignored via `.gitignore`)
- versioned hook scripts under `.htmlgraph/hooks/` (installed into `.git/hooks/` with `--install-hooks`)

### Python (SDK - Recommended)

```python
from htmlgraph import SDK

# Initialize (auto-discovers .htmlgraph directory)
sdk = SDK(agent="claude")

# Create and configure a feature with fluent API
feature = sdk.features.create("User Authentication") \
    .set_priority("high") \
    .set_description("Implement OAuth 2.0 login") \
    .add_steps([
        "Create login endpoint",
        "Add JWT middleware",
        "Write integration tests"
    ]) \
    .save()

print(f"Created: {feature.id}")

# Work on features
with sdk.features.edit(feature.id) as f:
    f.status = "in-progress"
    f.agent_assigned = "claude"
    f.steps[0].completed = True

# Query features
high_priority_todos = sdk.features.where(status="todo", priority="high")
for feat in high_priority_todos:
    print(f"- {feat.id}: {feat.title}")

# Create and configure a track with TrackBuilder
track = sdk.tracks.builder() \
    .title("Q1 Security Initiative") \
    .priority("high") \
    .add_feature("feature-001") \
    .add_feature("feature-002") \
    .create()

print(f"Created track: {track.id}")
```

### HTML File Format

HtmlGraph nodes are standard HTML files:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>User Authentication</title>
</head>
<body>
    <article id="feature-001"
             data-type="feature"
             data-status="in-progress"
             data-priority="high">

        <header>
            <h1>User Authentication</h1>
        </header>

        <nav data-graph-edges>
            <section data-edge-type="blocked_by">
                <h3>Blocked By:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="feature-002.html">Database Schema</a></li>
                </ul>
            </section>
        </nav>

        <section data-steps>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li data-completed="true">✅ Create auth routes</li>
                <li data-completed="false">⏳ Add middleware</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
    </article>
</body>
</html>
```

## Orchestrator Architecture: Flexible Multi-Agent Coordination

HtmlGraph implements an orchestrator pattern that coordinates multiple AI agents in parallel, preserving context efficiency while maintaining complete flexibility in model selection. Instead of rigid rules, the pattern uses **capability-first thinking** to choose the right tool (and model) for each task.

**Key Principles:**
- ✅ **Flexible model selection** - Any model can do any work; choose based on task fit and cost
- ✅ **Dynamic spawner composition** - Mix and match spawner types (Gemini, Copilot, Codex, Claude) within the same workflow
- ✅ **Cost optimization** - Use cheaper models for exploratory work, expensive models only for reasoning
- ✅ **Parallel execution** - Independent tasks run simultaneously, reducing total time

**Example: Parallel Exploration with Multiple Spawners**

```python
# All run in parallel - each uses the best tool for the job
Task(subagent_type="gemini-spawner",    # FREE exploration
     prompt="Find all authentication patterns in src/auth/")

Task(subagent_type="copilot-spawner",   # GitHub integration
     prompt="Check GitHub issues related to auth",
     allow_tools=["github(*)"])

Task(subagent_type="claude-spawner",    # Deep reasoning
     prompt="Analyze auth patterns for security issues")

# Orchestrator coordinates, subagents work in parallel
# Total time = slowest task (not sum of all)
# Cost = optimized (cheap exploration + expensive reasoning only)
```

**Spawner Types:**
- **Gemini Spawner** - FREE exploratory research, batch analysis (2M tokens/min)
- **Copilot Spawner** - GitHub-integrated workflows, git operations
- **Codex Spawner** - Code generation, coding completions
- **Claude Spawner** - Deep reasoning, analysis, strategic planning (any Claude model)

## Contributing

HtmlGraph is developed using HtmlGraph itself (dogfooding). This means:

- ✅ Every development action is replicable by users through the package
- ✅ We use the SDK, CLI, and plugins - not custom scripts
- ✅ Our development workflow IS the documentation

**See [`docs/archive/DEVELOPMENT.md`](docs/archive/DEVELOPMENT.md) for:**
- Dogfooding principles
- Replicable workflows
- Environment setup (PyPI tokens, etc.)
- Development best practices

**Quick start for contributors:**
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/shakestzd/htmlgraph
cd htmlgraph
uv sync

# Start tracking your work (dogfooding!)
uv run htmlgraph init --install-hooks
uv run htmlgraph serve  # View dashboard

# Use SDK for development
uv run python
>>> from htmlgraph import SDK
>>> sdk = SDK(agent="your-name")
>>> sdk.features.where(status="todo")
```
