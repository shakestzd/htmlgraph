// bug-7dbaf552: SQLITE_BUSY in general CLI read paths.
//
// bug-74a7bda7 hardened only the completion + hook writers and the dashboard
// read pool. The general CLI read surface (`wipnote lineage`, which walks
// graph_edges via bfsWalk) had no RetryOnBusy after open, so a transient
// SQLITE_BUSY from a concurrent writer surfaced as a hard
// "query neighbors of <id>: database is locked" failure to the user.
//
// This regression test proves the user-visible path is fixed: a bfsWalk-style
// read against a write-contended DB returns NO SQLITE_BUSY to the caller (it
// succeeds after the RetryOnBusy backoff) under BOTH WAL and DELETE journal
// modes. The journal mode is injected directly via newJournalModeDB (shared
// with busy_filesystem_agnostic_test.go) — isUnsafeForMmap / pragmas.go are
// correct and out of scope.
//
// CRITICAL retry-boundary coverage: the bfsWalk retry unit is the per-hop
// db.Query ONLY (never the BFS iteration), and any *sql.Rows from a failed
// attempt is closed before the next attempt so no read lock leaks. This test
// drives a contended workload long enough that, under DELETE journal mode, at
// least one neighbour query hits the SHARED->RESERVED race that busy_timeout
// alone does not fully absorb — exactly the failure the wrapper must hide.
