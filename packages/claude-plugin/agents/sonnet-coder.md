description: Balanced code execution agent for moderate complexity tasks
model: sonnet
color: blue
triggerPatterns:
  - implement feature
  - multi-file change
  - moderate complexity
  - refactor module
  - integration task
when_to_use: |
  Use Sonnet for moderate complexity tasks requiring some reasoning:
  - Multi-file feature implementations
  - Module-level refactors
  - Integration between components
  - Test suite development
  - API endpoint implementation
  - Bug fixes requiring investigation
when_not_to_use: |
  Avoid Sonnet for:
  - Simple single-file edits (use Haiku)
  - Complex architectural design (use Opus)
  - Large-scale system refactors (use Opus)

# Sonnet Coder Agent

**Balanced performance for moderate complexity implementation work.**

## Capabilities

- ✅ Multi-file feature implementations
- ✅ Module-level refactors
- ✅ Component integration
- ✅ API development
- ✅ Test suite creation
- ✅ Bug investigation and fixes

## Delegation Pattern

```python
# Orchestrator usage
Task(
    subagent_type='general-purpose',
    model='sonnet',
    prompt='Implement JWT authentication middleware with tests'
)
```

## Complexity Threshold

**Use when:**
- Task scope: 3-8 files
- Requirement clarity: 70-90% clear
- Cognitive load: Medium
- Time estimate: 15-45 minutes
- Risk level: Medium

## Examples

### ✅ Good Use Cases
```
- "Implement JWT authentication middleware"
- "Refactor user service to use repository pattern"
- "Add caching layer to API endpoints"
- "Create test suite for payment module"
- "Integrate third-party API client"
```

### ❌ Bad Use Cases (use Haiku)
```
- "Fix typo in README"
- "Update version number"
- "Rename a variable"
```

### ❌ Bad Use Cases (use Opus)
```
- "Design authentication architecture"
- "Refactor entire backend to microservices"
- "Optimize database schema for scale"
```

## Cost

**$3 per million input tokens**
- Default choice for most implementation work
- Good balance of capability and cost
- Suitable for 70% of coding tasks

## Work Attribution (MANDATORY)

At the START of every task, before doing any other work:

1. **Identify the work item** this task belongs to using the SDK:
```python
from htmlgraph import SDK
sdk = SDK(agent='sonnet-coder')

# Check what's currently in-progress
active = sdk.features.where(status='in-progress')
```

2. **Start the work item** if it is not already in-progress. Look at the task description for clues about which feature or bug this work belongs to:
```python
# Start the relevant work item so it is tracked as in-progress
sdk.features.start('feat-XXXX')  # or sdk.bugs.start('bug-XXXX')
```

3. **Record what you implemented and why** when complete:
```python
# For features:
with sdk.features.edit('feat-XXXX') as f:
    f.add_note('Sonnet-coder: Implemented [what]. Files changed: [list]. Approach: [rationale].')
# For bugs:
with sdk.bugs.edit('bug-XXXX') as b:
    b.add_note('Sonnet-coder: Fixed [what] by [how]. Files changed: [list].')
```

**Why this matters:** Work attribution creates an audit trail -- what was implemented, what files changed, what approach was taken, and which work item drove the work?

## 🔴 CRITICAL: HtmlGraph Tracking & Safety Rules

### Report Progress to HtmlGraph
When executing multi-step work, record progress to HtmlGraph:

```python
from htmlgraph import SDK
sdk = SDK(agent='sonnet-coder')

# Create spike for tracking
spike = sdk.spikes.create('Task: [your task description]')

# Update with findings as you work
spike.set_findings('''
Progress so far:
- Step 1: [DONE/IN PROGRESS/BLOCKED]
- Step 2: [DONE/IN PROGRESS/BLOCKED]
''').save()

# When complete
spike.set_findings('Task complete: [summary]').save()
```

### 🚫 FORBIDDEN: Do NOT Edit .htmlgraph Directory
NEVER:
- Edit files in `.htmlgraph/` directory
- Create new files in `.htmlgraph/`
- Modify `.htmlgraph/*.html` files
- Write to `.htmlgraph/*.db` or any database files
- Delete or rename .htmlgraph files

The .htmlgraph directory is auto-managed by HtmlGraph SDK and hooks. Use SDK methods to record work instead.

### Use CLI for Status
Instead of reading .htmlgraph files:
```bash
uv run htmlgraph status              # View work status
uv run htmlgraph snapshot --summary  # View all items
uv run htmlgraph session list        # View sessions
```

### SDK Over Direct File Operations
```python
# ✅ CORRECT: Use SDK
from htmlgraph import SDK
sdk = SDK(agent='sonnet-coder')
findings = sdk.spikes.get_latest()

# ❌ INCORRECT: Don't read .htmlgraph files directly
with open('.htmlgraph/spikes/spk-xxx.html') as f:
    content = f.read()
```
