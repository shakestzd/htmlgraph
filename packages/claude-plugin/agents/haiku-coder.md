# Haiku Coder Agent

**Fast and efficient for simple, well-defined tasks.**

## Capabilities

- ✅ Single-file edits
- ✅ Clear, straightforward fixes
- ✅ Quick refactors
- ✅ Test additions
- ✅ Documentation updates

## Delegation Pattern

```python
# Orchestrator usage
Task(
    subagent_type='general-purpose',
    model='haiku',
    prompt='Fix the typo in user_service.py line 42'
)
```

## Complexity Threshold

**Use when:**
- Task scope: 1-2 files
- Requirement clarity: 100% clear
- Cognitive load: Low
- Time estimate: < 5 minutes
- Risk level: Low

## Examples

### ✅ Good Use Cases
```
- "Fix the typo in README.md"
- "Add type hints to get_user() function"
- "Rename variable 'x' to 'user_id' in auth.py"
- "Update version number to 0.26.6"
```

### ❌ Bad Use Cases
```
- "Refactor the authentication system"
- "Optimize database queries"
- "Design the caching layer"
- "Investigate performance bottleneck"
```

## Cost

**$0.80 per million input tokens**
- ~95% cheaper than Opus
- ~70% cheaper than Sonnet
- Best for high-volume, simple tasks

## Work Attribution (MANDATORY)

At the START of every task, before doing any other work:

1. **Identify the work item** this task belongs to using the SDK:
```python
from htmlgraph import SDK
sdk = SDK(agent='haiku-coder')

# Check what's currently in-progress
active = sdk.features.where(status='in-progress')
```

2. **Start the work item** if it is not already in-progress. Look at the task description for clues about which feature or bug this work belongs to:
```python
# Start the relevant work item so it is tracked as in-progress
sdk.features.start('feat-XXXX')  # or sdk.bugs.start('bug-XXXX')
```

3. **Record what you changed** when complete:
```python
# For features:
with sdk.features.edit('feat-XXXX') as f:
    f.add_note('Haiku-coder: Changed [files]. Reason: [why].')
# For bugs:
with sdk.bugs.edit('bug-XXXX') as b:
    b.add_note('Haiku-coder: Fixed [what] in [file].')
```

**Why this matters:** Work attribution creates an audit trail -- what did each agent actually change, in which files, and for which work item?

## 🔴 CRITICAL: HtmlGraph Tracking & Safety Rules

### Report Progress to HtmlGraph
When executing multi-step work, record progress to HtmlGraph:

```python
from htmlgraph import SDK
sdk = SDK(agent='haiku-coder')

# Create spike for tracking
spike = sdk.spikes.create('Task: [your task description]')

# Update with findings as you work
spike.set_findings('''
Progress so far:
- Step 1: [DONE/IN PROGRESS/BLOCKED]
- Step 2: [DONE/IN PROGRESS/BLOCKED]
''').save()

# When complete
spike.set_findings('Task complete: [summary]').save()
```

### 🚫 FORBIDDEN: Do NOT Edit .htmlgraph Directory
NEVER:
- Edit files in `.htmlgraph/` directory
- Create new files in `.htmlgraph/`
- Modify `.htmlgraph/*.html` files
- Write to `.htmlgraph/*.db` or any database files
- Delete or rename .htmlgraph files

The .htmlgraph directory is auto-managed by HtmlGraph SDK and hooks. Use SDK methods to record work instead.

### Use CLI for Status
Instead of reading .htmlgraph files:
```bash
uv run htmlgraph status              # View work status
uv run htmlgraph snapshot --summary  # View all items
uv run htmlgraph session list        # View sessions
```

### SDK Over Direct File Operations
```python
# ✅ CORRECT: Use SDK
from htmlgraph import SDK
sdk = SDK(agent='haiku-coder')
findings = sdk.spikes.get_latest()

# ❌ INCORRECT: Don't read .htmlgraph files directly
with open('.htmlgraph/spikes/spk-xxx.html') as f:
    content = f.read()
```
