**Release Date:** December 23, 2025
**Type:** Patch Release (Bug Fix)

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Critical: Session Work Type Persistence

**Fixed session work type filtering returning empty results**

- **Issue:** `get_sessions_by_work_type()` analytics method always returned empty lists
- **Root Cause:** Session HTML serialization was missing `primary_work_type` and `work_breakdown` attributes
- **Impact:** Work Type Classification feature (introduced in 0.7.0) was non-functional
- **Files Changed:**
  - `src/python/wipnote/models.py` - Added `data-primary-work-type` and `data-work-breakdown` to Session HTML output
  - `src/python/wipnote/converter.py` - Updated `html_to_session()` to parse work type fields

**What was broken:**
```python
# This would always return []
spike_sessions = sdk.analytics.get_sessions_by_work_type("spike-investigation")
```

**Now works correctly:**
```python
# Returns sessions filtered by primary work type
spike_sessions = sdk.analytics.get_sessions_by_work_type("spike-investigation")
feature_sessions = sdk.analytics.get_sessions_by_work_type("feature-implementation")
```

## 📊 Technical Details

### Session HTML Format Enhancement

Sessions now persist work type classification data in HTML:

```html
<article id="session-123"
         data-type="session"
         data-primary-work-type="spike-investigation"
         data-work-breakdown='{"spike-investigation": 45, "feature-implementation": 30}'>
```

This ensures:
- ✅ Work type data survives HTML read/write cycles
- ✅ Analytics queries return accurate results
- ✅ Session filtering by work type works as intended

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Coverage
- ✅ All 298 tests passing across Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12
- ✅ Fixed failing tests:
  - `test_filter_by_spike_work_type`
  - `test_filter_by_feature_work_type`

### CI/CD Status
- ✅ GitHub Actions CI passing on all platforms
- ✅ Package build validated
- ✅ Documentation deployment successful

## 🔄 Upgrading from 0.7.1

**No breaking changes.** This is a drop-in replacement.

### Automatic Migration
Existing session HTML files will be automatically updated when:
1. Sessions are loaded via `html_to_session()`
2. `primary_work_type` or `work_breakdown` is set
3. Session is saved back to HTML via `session_to_html()`

No manual migration required.
